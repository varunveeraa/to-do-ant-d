A React app that implements a To-Do with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks, filtering and sorting the list of tasks, and updating the status of a task.

The app uses the Ant Design library for styling and UI components and MUI's TextField for text input.

The app maintains the state of the task list and the current editing status using the useState hook.

The app renders a table of tasks using the Ant Design Table component with columns defined in the columns array. The table allows the user to sort and filter the task list based on certain properties like the task's title, due date, and tag.

The app provides buttons for adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, and deleting tasks. It uses the Ant Design Modal component to prompt the user for confirmation before deleting a task.

When a user edits a task, the app displays a form that allows the user to modify the task's properties. If the user submits the form with valid data, the app updates the task list with the new values.

Overall, the app provides a simple interface for managing a list of tasks with basic features for filtering and sorting the task list and editing and deleting individual tasks.
